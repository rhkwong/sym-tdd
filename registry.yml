when_to_use: implementing features, fixing bugs, writing tests
not_when: quick prototyping, one-off scripts, exploratory spikes

scenarios:
  - add a new feature with full test coverage
  - fix a bug and add regression test
  - refactor with confidence using existing tests
  - write tests for untested legacy code

problems:
  - tests written after code miss edge cases
  - no consistent test structure
  - TDD workflow unclear for coding agents
